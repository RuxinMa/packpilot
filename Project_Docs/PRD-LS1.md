   - The sign-up popup should include:
     - Username, Password, and Confirm Password fields.
     - A "Sign Up" button (non-functional, as backend implementation is not required).
     - A message: "Already have an account? Log In"â€”clicking "Log In" should return the user to the login page.

##### User Authentication

a. Validation: Upon clicking the "Log in" button, the system must validate the username and password against the stored credentials.

b. Role-Based Access: After successful authentication, the system must redirect the user to the appropriate dashboard based on their selected role:
   - Manager: Redirect to the Manager Page.
   - Worker: Redirect to the Worker Page.

c. Error Handling: If the username or password is incorrect, display an error message: "Invalid username or password. Please try again."

   - Confirmation Popup: When the user clicks the "Log out" button, display a confirmation popup with the following details:
     - Message: "Are you sure you want to log out?"
     - Buttons:
       - Confirm Logout: A button labeled "Yes, Log out" that terminates the session and redirects the user to the login page.
       - Cancel: A button labeled "Cancel" that closes the popup and returns the user to their current page.
   - Session Termination: Upon confirmation, the system must:
     - Destroy the user's session.
     - Clear any session-related data (e.g., cookies, tokens).
     - Redirect the user to the login page.

##### Data Requirements

a. Username Rules:

     - Username: "Username must be 5-20 characters and can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores."
     - Password: "Password must be 8-30 characters and include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character."

##### Security Requirements

a. Password Encryption: Ensure that passwords are stored in the database using a secure hashing algorithm.

b. Input Sanitization: Sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL injection and other common security vulnerabilities.

c. Brute Force Protection: Implement mechanisms to prevent brute force attacks, such as account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts.

##### User Interface Requirements

  - User clicks on "Add" to save the changes, and the database and list are updated.
  - User clicks "Close" to terminate the modification and close the pop-up window.
- Delete item:
  - User clicks "X" button, a popup window will appear to confirm the deletion, prompting: "Are you sure you want to delete this item?"
  - User clicks confirm, the item is deleted from the database and the list is refreshed.
  - User clicks cancel, the confirmation window is closed and the deletion is not executed.

##### Administrator Page Status

**Default Status**

  - When administrator adds an item, the new item will be added to the list and details will be displayed.
  - Text exceeding the width of the form is displayed with an ellipsis.
  - When the added item exceeds the height of the container, adjust the control's appearances to support vertical scrolling.
  - The back-end/front-end needs to limit the max. number of items (e.g., 50 per task).
- Interaction:
  - Clicking the Edit button brings up the "Add Item" popup window, which is pre-filled with the item's current parameters.
  - Clicking the Delete button displays the Confirmation popup; clicking on the Confirmation button removes the item from the list.
