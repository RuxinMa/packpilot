# LS1 Warehouse Packing Project Overview

## Project Goal
We're creating a visualization tool to help warehouse workers optimize how they pack items, transforming what is currently an experience-based process into one guided by optimization algorithms.

## Project Scope
- The project addresses the gap between AI optimization solutions and practical implementation
- We'll be developing a web application to guide workers in following AI-recommended packing arrangements
