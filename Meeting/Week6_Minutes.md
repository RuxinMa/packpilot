## Time and Place

## Project Plan & Sprint Breakdown
Confirmed a six-sprint schedule, with each sprint lasting two weeks.

Current focus: Technical design (Sprint 2) and Division of labor in development (Sprint 3).

## Group Milestone
### 1. Overview 
The meeting focussed on the distribution of front-end and back-end tasks. The front-end environment has been set up (Ru Xin) and the back-end is partially completed (Fei Nan). Personnel assignments were made based on members' intentions and tasks.

### 2. Discussion and Suggestions from supervisor 
Alternate plan about having some of the delays in the development process:
#### 1. whether some requirements need to be cut.
#### 2. Contact the instructor and get help for any problems you can't solve during the development process.
After each member uploads a file, the other members need to understand what each file does, and if any member is unsure of what the file does, take the time to find out or ask the other members.

### 3. Team roles and division of labour：
Front-end team: team leader: Ruxin; members: Jiahui, Shiyu.

Shiyu will assist with the dockerize build.

Back-end team: team leader: Feinan; members: Xuran, Jiabao.

The detailed parts of each team still need to be broken down.

Everyone is involved in reviewing the data flow architecture of the project.

### 4. Git kanban task progress synchronisation：
Each member will create his/her own todo on git kanban and go ahead and update the status of the task in real time based on his/her progress.

The supervisor can use git kanban to keep track of each member's progress and status in real time.

## Action Items
Each member self-learns the basics based on the team they are assigned to so that they can develop better.

The next two weeks are term breaks where members are able to learn or develop on their own time.

There will be an internal student meeting every Friday after term break from 5-6pm, and regular meetings will still be held once a fortnight.

**Next meeting will be at 16:45 on 09 May.**
