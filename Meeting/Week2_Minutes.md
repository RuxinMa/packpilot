### b. Detailed Presentation
In this meeting, we reviewed the project requirements, which primarily focus on a web version. The interface will be divided into two sections: manager and worker, and a simple login interface is required. The frontend will need to support 3D/2D presentation and listing, along with defining how to interface with the backend team. We decided to set milestones every two weeks to review progress. The first sprint will focus on understanding the requirements and completing the pitch presentation. The second sprint will involve finalizing technical and development documentation and starting to learn the necessary technologies. The third and fourth sprints will emphasize web development, while the fifth sprint will focus on testing and delivery.
