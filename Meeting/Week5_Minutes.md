## Project Plan & Sprint Breakdown
Confirmed a six-sprint schedule, with each sprint lasting two weeks.

Current focus: Technical design (Sprint 2).

Upcoming: Division of labor in development (Sprint 3).

## Group Milestone
### 1. Overview
The team finished the Q&A section of the presentation, asked relevant questions, and received suggestions for improvement from the supervisor. The weekly PDF tasks were divided among members accordingly.
### 2. Q&A
**Pre-meeting Questions**

Supervisors confirmed the list of individual assignments for the production of the two-minute presentation and requirements document for each person.

**One-on-one Q&A**

- The basic ideas behind the current interface design were introduced, including the user interaction process and page layout structure.
- The “upward definition” was explained, as well as how to visually interact with the system and display it. It was planned to clearly communicate this to customers through schematic diagrams.
- For the modeling part, the team discussed how to select highlighted content to improve user readability and the operation experience.
- The feasibility and necessity of the logout function were confirmed, and it was planned to be implemented as an auxiliary module.
- The future expansion direction of the system was discussed, such as AI classification enhancement and task management automation.
- The most likely functions to be implemented in the near future were predicted, and technical difficulties that may be encountered were also raised, such as graphical interaction and 3D model loading problems.


### 3. Discussion and Suggestions from supervisor
- Project requirements need to be finalized within this week to avoid repeated rework in the future. Clarify the division of labor and determine the tasks and deadlines of each member.
- Complete this week's work content, including the implementation plan for the milestone function. Confirm the schedule of the next meeting and check the current progress.
- The focus was on the way in which the interfaces between the various parts of the system are connected, in particular the calls between the algorithm modules and the interfaces.
- A document will be sent as an example to explore how to achieve a smooth flow of data while maintaining the independence of the modules.

### 4. Week 5 Assignment and milestones
- The first milestone is to implement some core functions, and the initial results should be demonstrated before the seventh week, if possible earlier than planned.
- The following specific division of labor and deadlines have been set:

- **Part 1:** - Xuran, Jiabao  
- **Part 2:**
- 
   **2.1:** - Ruxin, Feinan  
   **2.2:** - Shiyu 
- Individual task deadlines are this Friday, and the work will be summarized and uploaded on Saturday.


## Action Items
- **Finalize** and **share** the updated requirement demo for review in the group.  
- **No student meeting this week**; focus on completing the **Week 5 Business Case & Draft Plan submission**.  
- Future client meetings will follow a **bi-weekly sprint schedule**, occurring in **Sprint end weeks (Weeks 6, 8, and 10)**, covering **sprint reviews & next sprint plans**.  

**Next meeting will be at 16:45 on 11 April.**
